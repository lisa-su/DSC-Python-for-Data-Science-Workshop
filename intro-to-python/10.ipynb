    "## Network Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Two basic python libraries that allow dealing with graphs are `networkx` and `graphviz`. The second of these is fairly small and really just for visualising graphs (see [graphviz documentation](http://graphviz.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for details). \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* If either of these libraries is not installed on your own computer may need to use `conda install graphviz python-graphviz networkx` using the Anaconda commandline.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `networkx` library has an extensive set of graph algorithms implemented for graphs, directed graphs and multigraphs (graphs/networks with parallel edges). Note that the aim of this is mainly to provide \"ease of use\" rather than efficiency, so everything is stored in dictionaries. For example, each edge has a data dictionary associated with it. To store the upper bound and capacity for this, it is necessary to store something like \n",
    "`data={\"capacity\":3, \"weight\": 5.5}` to specify that the edge has an upper bound of 3 on flow, and a cost of 5. This is not very efficient. In fact the first thing any of the algorithm implementations do is to map all data back to lists! Also, while the library doesn't specifically prohibit it, it generally doesn't handle floating point values very well (no allowance for $\\epsilon$ differences that can occur due to numerical errors). \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence the `networkx` library is useful for validating any code you write, but it is expected that normally it will be possible with a little effort to create better performing methods for any of the algorithms in this library. For more information about the library see the [networkx documentation](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/index.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating and displaying a random graph\n",
    "Here we create a random graph and provide a small utility function that converts a networkx graph object to the corresponding graphviz object for the purposes of diplaying it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some useful methods for graph objects from the networkx library include\n",
    "  * `G.nodes_iter()` iterates over all nodes in the graph object G. Nodes are usually indexed by integers from 0.\n",
    "  * `G.edges_iter()` returns (tail,head) pairs for each edge in the graph object G. Optionally you can use `G.edges_iter(data=True)` to get (tail,head,dataDictionary) objects.\n",
    "  * `G.out_edges_iter(n)`, `G.in_edges_iter(n)` and `G.edges_iter(n)` iterates over the edges pointing out, in and all edges attached to node `n` respectively. Again these iterators return (tail,head) or (tail,head,data) tuples\n",
    "  * All of the above methods have an equivalent method without the `_iter` in the name which simply return a list. So `G.nodes()` is equivalent to `[n for n in G.nodes_iter()]`\n",
    " \n",
    "The networkx library handles parallel edges - but this was clearly an afterthought and is not done well. It changes the data type from `DiGraph` to `MultiDiGraph` and there is no easy way to refer to one of a set of parallel edges.\n"
