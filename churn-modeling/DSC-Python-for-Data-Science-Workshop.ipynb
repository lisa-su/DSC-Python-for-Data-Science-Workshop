    "\n",
    "# Data Pre-processing\n",
    "# This is the first step in building a machine learning model. Data pre-processing refers to the transformation of data\n",
    "# before feeding it into the model. It deals with the techniques that are used to convert unusable raw data into clean \n",
    "# reliable data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Since data collection is often not performed in a controlled manner, raw data often contains outliers \n",
    "# (for example, age = 120), nonsensical data combinations (for example, model: bicycle, type: 4-wheeler), missing values, \n",
    "# scale problems, and so on. Because of this, raw data cannot be fed into a machine learning model because it might \n",
    "# compromise the quality of the results. As such, this is the most important step in the process of data science.\n",

    "# Model Learning\n",
    "# After pre-processing the data and splitting it into train/test sets (more on this later), we move on to modeling. Models \n",
    "# are nothing but sets of well-defined methods called algorithms that use pre-processed data to learn patterns, which can \n",
    "# later be used to make predictions. There are different types of learning algorithms, including supervised, semi-supervised, \n",
    "# unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. These will be discussed later.\n",

    "# Model Evaluation\n",
    "# In this stage, the models are evaluated with the help of specific performance metrics. With these metrics, we can go on to \n",
    "# tune the hyperparameters of a model in order to improve it. This process is called hyperparameter optimization. We will \n",
    "# repeat this step until we are satisfied with the performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Evaluate Algorithms\n",
    "# a) Split-out validation dataset\n",
    "# b) Test options and evaluation metric\n",
    "# c) Spot Check Algorithms\n",
    "# d) Compare Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "# Prediction\n",
    "# Once we are happy with the results from the evaluation step, we will then move on to predictions. Predictions are made \n",
    "# by the trained model when it is exposed to a new dataset. In a business setting, these predictions can be shared with \n",

    "# of the model to build an application with the new data. Depending on the business requirements, the deployment may be a \n",
    "# report, or it may be some repetitive data science steps that are to be executed. After deployment, a model needs proper \n",
    "# management and maintenance at regular intervals to keep it up and running.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. Finalize Model\n",

In conjunction with `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`, `Pandas` provides a wide range of opportunities for visual analysis of tabular data.\n",

You can see it as a dictionary of `Series` instances. `DataFrames` are great for representing real data: rows correspond to instances (examples, observations, etc.), and columns correspond to features of these instances."

Predictive models that use this numerical data for analysis might sometimes mistake these labels for some kind of order (for example, a model might think that a label of 3 is \"better\" than a label of 1, which is incorrect). In order to avoid this confusion, we can use one-hot encoding. Here, the label-encoded data is further divided into n number of columns. Here, n denotes the total number of unique labels generated while performing label encoding. For example, say that three new labels are generated through label encoding. Then, while performing one-hot encoding, the columns will be divided into three parts. So, the value of n is 3. Let's look at an exercise to get further clarification."
